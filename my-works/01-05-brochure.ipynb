One example is that, when we started working for our new client Wattsight, he was novice to Python language. But to my surprise, he adapted very quickly and started contributing to the project with great efficiency. He has a great knowledge in ML and Data Science fields, which helped us a lot when we aggregate data from different sources. He is also very self sufficient, which made it very easy for me to supervise him. He can take care of his tasks on his own and have his own discussions with PO and analysts when needed. he has a great passion for software development, ML and open source community. He is a great asset to our team and highly recommend him. Wishing him all the best.”\n",
